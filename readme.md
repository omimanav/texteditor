### A very basic text editor made using tkinter-python.

Don't expect too much for now, I'm still figuring out how to implement a few more features. 
So far I've implemented a couple of fundamental keyboard shortcuts:
* CTRL+N - New/Clear
* CTRL+S - Save
* CTRL+SHIFT+S - Save as..
* CTRL+O - Open file
* CTRL+W - Close window
* CTRL+` - Toggle status bar
* CTRL+BackSpace - Delete word --will be updating

Features to be added:
* CTRL+F - find text
* Syntax highlighting
* Toggle menubar
* Tab-character width
I've chosen to hide the menubar by default, I personally find it to be a distraction but I will be adding a toggle option in the future.

Otherwise a pretty simply written code that's easy to follow, I'll make a separate config file once the features are done with but you can easily just edit the main file.

Feel free to contact me regarding requests, help or suggestions.
